## Prototyping

Just add this script to have all the u1-stuff available on demand (without including them):  
"basic css", "u1-classes", "u1-attributes", "u1-custom-elements"  
```html
<script type=module src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/u1ui/u1/auto.min.js"></script>
```

This demo will give you an idea of how to develop:
